# Ball and Pipe Control System 
MATLAB codes to open serial communication with a ball and pipe system. The system is made of a vertical cylinder with a ping pong ball controlled by a fan on the bottom and height measured by a time of flight sensor on top. The objective is to balance the ball at a target altitude. 

# Q Learning Control Method and Application
The control method used for this system is Q learning. Q learning is a machine learning algorithm designed to train an "agent" in an environment. In this project, the agent of the control system is the fan. The idea of Q learning is to use continuous Q values (action values?) to continually improve the learning behavior of the agent. 

To implement this in MATLAB, the first step is to establish the control variables of the system. These control variables are ball position (p), fan speed (f), and velocity (v).
